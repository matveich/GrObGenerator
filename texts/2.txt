Flying Home

Who are you? Who am I? 
 Is it real to touch the sky? 
 Nothing's real for the sky,- 
 Said the birds of paradise 
 
 I'm afraid, can't you see?! 
 Tell me,where you carry me? 
 You will soon realize!- 
 Said the birds of paradise. â€” uu-u uu-u 
 
 
 Flying home, flying home 
 To the land that you once had known 
 To the peace that once was true 
 For a little girl like you. 
 
 Flying home, flying home 
 From the world that is made of stone 
 Till your heart is light and free 
 Like it once was meant to be. 
 
 How I can go ahead, 
 When my eyes are becoming wet? 
 Save your tears! Dry your eyes!- 
 Said the birds of paradise. 
 
 By the time is passing by 
 Say,how long do we have to fly? 
 Moon will set-sun will rise!- 
 Said the birds of paradise. 
 
 Flying home, flying home 
 To the land that you once had known 
 To the peace that once was true 
 For a little girl like you. uu-u 
 
 Flying home, flying home 
 From the world that is made of stone 
 Till your heart is light and free 
 Like it once was meant to be. 
 
 What the sun!And here`s the light! 
 Now I know what I`ve heard was right! 
 Morning sun can make you wise,- 
 Said the birds of paradise. 
 The birds of paradise. 
 The birds of paradise.
